# Poll-Application-Using-Django

Riddhi Radia here and I designed a Django-based poll application so people could vote on a poll, create a poll and delete it. 
If you are the one who created the poll, then you are the only one who can delete it. 
The number of people that voted in the poll can be seen in the view results section, where you see how many counts have been selected for each particular option along with the total number of votes. 
Changing passwords is also an option, and for signup it accepts 5 to 20 characters in username and minimum of eight characters in password, and this Poll Application is completely responsive.
